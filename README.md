Project: Forex Trading Signal Generator and Automated Trading System

Overview:

This project demonstrates a simple forex trading signal generator and automated trading system using the OANDA API. It utilizes a basic technical indicator to identify potential trading opportunities and places market orders accordingly.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
yfinance library
pandas library
apscheduler library
oandapyV20 library
OANDA API account with access token
Installation:

Install the required libraries using pip:
Bash
pip install yfinance pandas apscheduler oandapyV20
Use code with caution. Learn more
Obtain your OANDA API access token from your OANDA account.
Usage:

Update the access_token and accountID variables in the config.py file with your OANDA API credentials.

Run the main.py script to start the automated trading system.

Description:

The code consists of two main parts:

Signal Generation:

The signal_generator function takes a DataFrame of historical price data as input and generates a trading signal based on a simple technical indicator. The indicator identifies potential trading opportunities based on the opening and closing prices of the previous two candles.

Automated Trading:

The trading_job function periodically retrieves the latest price data, generates a trading signal, and executes a market order based on the signal. It uses the OANDA API to place market orders and set take-profit and stop-loss orders.

Example Usage:

The code will continuously monitor the EUR/USD forex pair and generate trading signals based on the technical indicator. When a signal is identified, the code will place a market order of 1000 units in the direction of the signal. If the signal is bearish, it will sell 1000 units of EUR/USD, and if the signal is bullish, it will buy 1000 units of EUR/USD. The code will also set take-profit and stop-loss orders based on the indicator.

Limitations:

This is a simple example of a forex trading signal generator and automated trading system. It is not intended to be a comprehensive or robust trading system. It does not consider various factors that could affect trading decisions, such as risk management, market conditions, and technical analysis.
